TEXT To SPEECH

This module will convert text to human understandable language, here English, so that a deaf or a dumb person can type whatever he wants to speak to a normal person and the rest of the work of speaking to the person will be done by the software UDSLI provided by us.

TEXT Scrapping

This module is divided into two parts i.e., 1. Interpreting voice from the user and converting it to text so that a deaf person can read whatever a normal person is speaking, 2. Interpreting from a audio file to text so that a deaf person can read whatever is spoken in a recorded audio file.
